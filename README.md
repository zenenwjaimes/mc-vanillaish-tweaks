# mc-vanillaish-tweaks

A minecraft mod that adds/fixes functionality in the game that will hopefully one day be added to the vanilla game.

As it stands now, the mod adds the following:

1. Shulker preview overlay. I borrowed the texture file from a different mod (sorry, can't remember who! will update with credit if I do).
2. Updated the cloud height to 256.
3. Suspicious stew information to be able to see what effect the stew gives. Sometimes the effect is too little to be able to know what it did.
4. On the release of the Trident w/ Loyalty, the mod saves the slot spot and tries to reuse the same spot when it returns to your player.
5. Change the block breaking on blocks that should inherit the properties of the base block (Smooth Quartz and Smooth Sandstone). 

I am very new to Fabric and Mixins so I may be doing a lot of things wrong, this is more of a mod for personal use (in MC and in learning modding). 

My main goal is to not break the vanilla experience or make something overpowered.
